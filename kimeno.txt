Video Overview
--------------

Hello guys, this video is a basic introduction to React hooks. React hooks were added 
in 16.8 version of React and allow us to use lifecycle and state in functional
components. The real benefit however, is that you can also create your own custom hooks 
and reuse them wherever you want in your application.

So we are going to do all of that by creating a simple login form 



Set react app
--------------
Ok so we are going to use create-react-app

so assuming you already have node type:

**
ACTION TYPE:
npx create-react-app react-hooks-loginform
**

and if you don't have it google node

**
ACTION:
(go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and show download link)
**

...here, download it and install it.


When the app is installed
cd react-hooks-loginform
npm start



Create LoginSreen component adding to App when you have something to show
When you add handleSubmit time for useState then -> onChange!

------------
|> USE state 
------------
To set form values we need state and setState 

use event only and event.target.name

const onChange = e => {
    const name = e.target.name;
    setFormValues({ ...formValues, [name]: e.target.value });
  };

  <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          value={formValues.username}
          onChange={e => onChange(e)}
        />
